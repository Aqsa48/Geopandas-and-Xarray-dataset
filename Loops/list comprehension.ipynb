For every file name in file_list, read it with pandas and store the results in a list called dfs.

import pandas as pd

# Pretend these are file names
file_list = ["file1.csv", "file2.csv", "file3.csv"]

# Function that simulates reading a CSV
def fake_read_csv(filename):
    return pd.DataFrame({
        "file_name": [filename],
        "value": [len(filename)]  # just some dummy data
    })

# Same logic as pd.read_csv but using our fake function
dfs = [fake_read_csv(f) for f in file_list]

# Print results
for df in dfs:
    print(df)
    print()
